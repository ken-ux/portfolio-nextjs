          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a UX designer, occasionally moonlighting as a frontend
            developer, who has shipped products for both web and mobile. I love
            curating entertaining experiences through deliberate visual and
            interactive design. I adore every step of the design process; from
            intial idea to implementation, I have the skills to support projects
            at any part of the development lifecycle.
            <br />
            <br />
            A core aspect of my identity comes from my upbringing as a
            first-generation, Vietnamese-American, unapologetically queer man in
            Seattle who also played <em>a lot</em> of Nintendo 64. 
            The resiliency and diversity of the communities I was
            raised in and part of established the drive I have in promoting
            visibility for queer people of color in creative industries.
            <br />
            <br />
            I graduated from the University of Washington with an M.S. in
            Information Management. I did my undergrad at the same institution,
            where I earned a dual BA/BS in Public Health and Biology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some of my hobbies include watercolor painting, digital art, film
            photography, comics (I primarily read DC), and mobile/PC gaming. A
            few game series I like include Pok√©mon, Shin Megami Tensei, Bravely,
            and Taiko no Tatsujin.
