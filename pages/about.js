            I&apos;m a UX designer occasionally moonlighting as a frontend
            developer. Starting off as a mostly self-taught coder, my interests
            led me to UX in pursuit of a deeper understanding of why things are
            the way they are. I love expanding how people experience the world
            through visual and interactive design.
            <br />
            <br />
            A core aspect of my identity is being a first-generation
            Vietnamese-American growing up around South Seattle. In addition, as
            a queer person of color, I heavily draw inspiration from the
            resiliency of communities I am part of and continue to learn more
            about.
            <br />
            <br />
            I graduated from the University of Washington with an M.S. in
            Information Management. I did my undergrad at the same institution,
            where I earned a dual BA/BS in Public Health and Biology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some of my hobbies include watercolor painting, digital art, film
            photography, comics (I primarily read DC), and mobile/PC gaming. A
            few game series I like include Pok√©mon, Shin Megami Tensei, Bravely,
            and Taiko no Tatsujin.
