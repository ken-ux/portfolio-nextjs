# Next.js Portfolio

## Description

This is my previous portfolio website. It can be accessed here: [(https://portfolio-ken-ux.vercel.app/)]

This website uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps. It is hosted by Vercel, a platform designed for Next.js applications.

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
