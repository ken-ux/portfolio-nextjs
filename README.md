# Next.js Portfolio

## Description

This is my previous portfolio website. The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
